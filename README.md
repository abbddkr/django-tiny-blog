# Django Tiny Blog

Django Tiny Blog is a RESTful API-based tiny blog application built with Django Rest Framework. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts and users. The API is secured, and users must provide a JSON Web Token key to perform CRUD operations.

## Features
- Authentication: Users can obtain a JWT token by providing valid credentials.
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete Posts: Users can perform CRUD operations on blog posts.
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete Users: Admin users can manage user accounts.
- Security: JWT authentication is implemented to ensure secure access to the API.
- Easy Admin Panel: This project includes Django's built-in Admin Dashboard, providing an easy interface for managing and updating content.

## Usage

To use the Django Tiny Blog API, you can make HTTP requests to the available endpoints below.

### Authentication

To access protected endpoints, you need to include the JWT token in the request header as follows:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`


## Generate a Token

To obtain a JWT token, follow these steps:

Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/api/token/` with your username and password in the request body.
```
POST /api/token/
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password"
}
```

### Endpoints
